A collection of practical functional libraries for reactive typescript programming.

## Packages

- [@fun-land/accessor](packages/accessor) - A library for doing immutable updates and querying on nested data structures in a way that is composable and powerful.
- [@fun-land/use-fun-state](packages/use-fun-state) - A React.js hook enabling fractal, compositional state in a way that is type-safe, testable, and easy to refactor.
- [@fun-land/validation](packages/validation) - A micro-library for validating deep application state using accessors.
- [@fun-land/observable-fun-state](packages/observable-fun-state) - A function to create an `Observable<FunState<State>>`, enabling usage of fun-state without React.js.
