<h1 align="center">Fun-State</h1>

@fun-land/fun-state is a framework-agnostic library for doing fractal, compositional state in a way that is type-safe,
testable, and easy to refactor.

# Getting Started

TODO! No way to use this library without a framework has been documented. You may want to use [@fun-land/use-fun-state](../use-fun-state) in the meantime.
